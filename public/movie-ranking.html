<h1>The Best Movies According to Ace</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Dune</h3>
<p>One of the best sc-fi mobies ive seen so far rich in
the story line and in the character development, probably
the best saga ive watched in the last 10 years.</p>
<h3>The Harry Potter Franchise</h3>
<p>This 7 movie franchise is simply a masterpice in my opinion
   from the first to the end you get a rich story line and incredible 
   plots to the story, all the movies have importnat factors to them
   and i find that the acting and the scenery in the movie is perfect,
   this movie really gets me immersed in the story and the world a big reason
   to why i love it.</p>
   <h3>Scarface</h3>
   <p>A classic and a masterpiece in my opinion as well tells
       the tale of a low class immigrant coming to the US.
       Following the american dream, and how he does anything to achieve it 
       shows how a life of crime can get you to the top very quick but will lead 
       you to a downfall almost twice as quick. Incredible acting by Alpacino,
       and shows how this type of lifestyle can turn you into a monster.</p>
